# MusicApp Proposal  
## What is my app?  (Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)  
  It's a music app that creates playlists for users and can hopefully play the playlist as well.
  
## Wireframe  (Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more) 


## Initial thoughts on game structure  (Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
  I want to be able to create multiple playlist for each user but I'm not sure how complicated that will end up being.  The most basic version of my app with just one playlist per user will be very similar to the favorites charts we used previously.

## Phases of Completion  (The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)  
Accessing information in Spotify API

Writing out the basic structure with Express and the MVC pattern

Writing out the methods for creating, deleting, editing

Include search using already input
